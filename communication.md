Communication

## Learning from Misunderstandings
Misunderstandings are one of the most effect barometers you can use to gauge your ability as an effective communicator. Any time that you have a misunderstanding with someone you should take it as an oppotunity to learn. Misunderstandings represent a breakdown of communication and represent a divergence from what the speaker intended to say and the listener heard and understood.
