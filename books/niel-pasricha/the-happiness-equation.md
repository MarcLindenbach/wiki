## Neil Pasricha

### Quotes
  - The problem is we think we shouldn’t have negative thoughts.
  - Unhappiness is nature’s way of keeping people on their toes. It’s a crude system, but it has worked for thousands of years.
  - We scan the world for problems because that led to our survival. And our current design of the world only reinforces and grows these negative-lens feelings.
  - Viktor Frankl says, “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”
  - Walt Whitman writes, “Keep your face always toward the sunshine—and shadows will fall behind you.”
  - If I knew everything about your life circumstances—your job, your health, your marital status, your income—I could predict only 10% of your happiness. That’s it! The remaining amount is not determined by your external world but by the way your brain processes it.
  - Find your flow. However you characterize it, when you’re completely absorbed with what you’re doing, it means you’re being challenged and demonstrating skill at the same time. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi describes this moment as “being completely involved in an activity for its own sake. The ego falls away. Time flies. Every action, movement, and thought follows inevitably from the previous one, like playing jazz.

  - Meg Jacobs writes in Technology and Culture about the growth of the Culture of More between 1890 and 1930: “As new technologies enabled mass production and mass distribution, Americans no longer had to just be content with what they had; they could act on their desires. No longer a sin, envy was now a staple of the new consumer economy.”
  - The goal is not to be perfect. The goal is just to be better than before.
  - It is a commonplace observation that work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion. Thus, an elderly lady of leisure can spend the entire day in writing and dispatching a postcard to her niece at Bognor Regis. An hour will be spent in finding the postcard, another in hunting for spectacles, half-an-hour in a search for the address, an hour and a quarter in composition, and twenty minutes in deciding whether or not to take an umbrella when going to the pillar-box in the next street. The total effort which would occupy a busy man for three minutes all told may in this fashion leave another person prostrate after a day of doubt, anxiety and toil.
  - Remove all entry points to your brain except a single one you can control.
  - How to make every decision at twice the speed? Remove choice. What’s the counterintuitive way to having more time? Remove time. How to add an hour to the day with only one small change? Remove access.
  - “Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.”
