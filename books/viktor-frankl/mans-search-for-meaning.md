## Viktor E. Frankl

### Quotes
  - Thus suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind (p 44)
  - No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honesty whether in a similar situation he might not have done the same. (p 48)
  - Dostoevski said once, “There is only one thing that I dread: not to be worthy of my sufferings.” (p 66)
  - Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual. (p 77)
  - When a man finds that it is his destiny to suffer, he will have to accept his suffering as his task; his single and unique task. He will have to acknowledge the fact that even in suffering he is unique and alone in the universe. No one can relieve him of his suffering or suffer in his place. His unique opportunity lies in the way in which he bears his burden. (p 77)
  - no one has the right to do wrong, not even if wrong has been done to them. (p 91)
  - What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task. (p 105)
  - “our current mental-hygiene philosophy stresses the idea that people ought to be happy, that unhappiness is a symptom of maladjustment. Such a value system might be responsible for the fact that the burden of unavoidable unhappiness is increased by unhappiness about being unhappy.” (114)
  - To the European, it is a characteristic of the American culture that, again and again, one is commanded and ordered to “be happy.” But happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue. One must have a reason to “be happy.” Once the reason is found, however, one becomes happy automatically. As we see, a human being is not one in pursuit of happiness but rather in search of a reason to become happy, last but not least, through actualizing the potential meaning inherent and dormant in a given situation. (p 138)
  - people have enough to live by but nothing to live for; they have the means but no meaning. (p 140)
  - Live as if you were living for the second time and had acted as wrongly the first time as you are about to act now. (p 150)
  - “George, you must realize that the world is a joke. There is no justice, everything is random. Only when you realize this will you understand how silly it is to take yourself seriously. There is no grand purpose in the universe. It just is. There’s no particular meaning in what decision you make today about how to act.” (p152)
