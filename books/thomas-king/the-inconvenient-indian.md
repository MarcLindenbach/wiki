# The Inconvenient Indian: A Curious Account of Native People in North America
## Thomas King

### Quotes
  - "Lately, Indians have become First Nations in Canada and Native Americans in the United States, but the fact of the matter is that there has never been a good collective noun because there never was a collective to begin with."
  - "While we have dispensed with guns and bugles, and while North America’s sense of its own superiority is better hidden, its disdain muted, twenty-first-century attitudes towards Native people are remarkably similar to those of the previous centuries."
  - "we don’t need the truth. We have the legend."
  - "For us Live Indians, being invisible is annoying enough, but being inauthentic is crushing."
  - "In order to maintain the cult and sanctity of the Dead Indian, North America has decided that Live Indians living today cannot be genuine Indians."
  - "As with the Dead Indian, North America has, for a very long time now, insisted on a collective noun for Live Indians—Indians, Aboriginals, First Nations, Natives, First Peoples—even though there are over 600 recognized nations in Canada and over 550 recognized nations in the United States."
  - "Missionary work in the New World was war. Christianity, in all its varieties, has always been a stakeholder in the business of assimilation, and, in the sixteenth century, it was the initial wound in the side of Native culture. Or, if you want the positive but somewhat callous view, you might wish to describe Christianity as the gateway drug to supply-side capitalism."
  - "So, if I’ve got it right, while North America is reluctant to support the economic “incompetence” of Native people, it is more than willing to throw money at the incompetence of corporations. And why not? After all, if we’ve learned nothing in the last century, we should have learned that government support of big business is capitalism’s only hope."
  - "Delayed gratification is not a North American trait."
  - "More to the point, they [whites] get to make their mistakes as individuals and not as representatives of an entire race."
  - "I have previously stated that I should be considered a mixed-blood: that is, I claim to be a male but in fact only one of my parents was male.”
  - "Whenever I get up in the morning and start to write I believe that I’m going to make some kind of a difference, even though I know in my heart that I won’t, I still do it anyway. And I go ahead as if I will."
